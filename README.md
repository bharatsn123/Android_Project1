# Anagrams - Word Game project
This project introduces the data structure concepts – ArrayLists, HashSets
and HashMaps, to build a word-game.
<br><br>
An anagram is a word formed by rearranging the letters of another
word. For example, cinema is an anagram of iceman.
<br><br>
The mechanics of the game are as follows: <br>
• The game provides the user with a word from the dictionary. <br>
• The user tries to create as many words as possible that containall the
letters of the given word plus one additional letter. <br>
<br><br>
## Usage 

* <B>On the home screen, please choose "Third Milestone".</B><br>
This app was created to teach my students in one of the Android workshops and it had three different milestones, so this was used as a preview to see how the app worked at different milestones. The final app can be experienced when clicked on third milestone button.
