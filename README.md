# Anagrams - Word Game project
This project introduces the data structure concepts – ArrayLists, HashSets
and HashMaps, to build a word-game.
<br><br>
An anagram is a word formed by rearranging the letters of another
word. For example, cinema is an anagram of iceman.
<br><br>
The mechanics of the game are as follows: <br>
• The game provides the user with a word from the dictionary. <br>
• The user tries to create as many words as possible that contain all the
letters of the given word plus one additional letter. <br>

## Usage 

* <B>On the home screen, please choose "Third Milestone".</B><br>
This app was created to teach my students in one of the Android workshops and it had three different steps/milestones for attendees to understand, so this was used as a preview to see how the app worked at different milestones. The full working app can be experienced when clicked on third milestone button.

## Rules of the game

* You need to build Anagram of the given word. For example "iceman" can be rearranged to be written as "cinema".

* But there's a twist!! You need to add one additional letter(any alphabet) to the given word and make an anagram with it. "spare" can be rearranged with the additional letter 'j' to create the word "jasper" (and that's what makes this pretty tough).

* Here's what you cannot do. Suppose the word given by the App is "reward", you cannot add an 's' to make it "rewards". Its technically the same word, so its not accepted as a valid anagram with an extra letter in the game. 

* Once you have entered your first guess, you can see an action button on the right bottom of the screen, on which once you click, you will get all the possible anagrams with one letter added to the original word.
