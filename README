This project introduces the data structure concepts – ArrayLists, HashSets
and HashMaps, to build a word-game.

An anagram is a word formed by rearranging the letters of another
word. For example, cinema is an anagram of iceman.

The mechanics of the game are as follows:
• The game provides the user with a word from the dictionary.
• The user tries to create as many words as possible that contain all the
letters of the given word plus one additional letter.
